//! THE PROMETHEUS EXPORT SINK — `export.<name>.module: prometheus`.
//!
//! A PULL sink on the export kind's memory ABI. The host keeps what only the host can own: the
//! recorder every emit site writes, its scrape-time gauges and the hook-metrics cache, which it
//! lends through its kind-neutral snapshot service. This sink owns the rest (owner law 2026-09-27:
//! "/metrics and /metrics/hooks leave core"): it carries the `metrics` stream (the instance
//! subscribed to it is the scrape sink), it validates the settings an operator writes for it, it
//! declares the well-known `GET /metrics` and `GET /metrics/hooks` as its own routes, and its
//! `serve` reads the host's families (`snapshot.read`, in the recorder's order) and answers the
//! exposition in 1.5.5's bytes and content types.
//!
//! One door, both ways in: [`door::door`] is the row a busbar build links, and the sibling
//! `busbar-export-prometheus-plugin` cdylib exports the same door as its one symbol.
